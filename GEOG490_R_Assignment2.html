        The analysis performed through this project was on a comprehensive dataset 
        containing information on fire statistics from 1962 to 2023 from the Oregon 
        Department of Forestry. This report specifically focuses on data between 2013 
        and 2023. The aim is to study the prevalence across fire patterns for different 
        factors with data from the last decade for a more relevant look and understanding 
        of fire behavior in Oregon. The visualizations presented below capture the 
        prevalence of fires based on flame height and fire size in acres, providing valuable 
        insights into the dynamics of wildfires during this significant timeframe.

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
      The majority of fires exhibit a flame height of one foot. There is a significant decrease in the number 
      of fires as the flame height increases. With each foot of flame height growth there is an exponential decrease 
      in flame height. Analyzing this trend, along with the causes of these fires can contribute to an understanding 
      and development of predictive models of for estimating fire height based on specific causes of the fire. 
      There is also a disproportionately high number of fires that remain smaller than 50,000 acres during peak fire 
      spread. This information has the potential to lead to predictive models focused on analyzing fire size. 
      When studying specific regions and zones, this data coupled with NDVI, aspect, slope, and insolation data, 
      enables the creation of potential fire risk indexes. These indices facilitate predictions regarding the potential 
      size a fire may reach.
